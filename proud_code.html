            <p>I'm proud of a lot of code I've written, and <strong>I have included links</strong> to some below, but it's not just the code itself that I'm proud of.</p>
            <h4>It's the entire engineering design process behind the code.</h4>
            <p>Sure, we don't want to over-engineer things, or spend so long in the boilerplate that we never get to the functionality. But it's easy to make small mistakes when trying to code up a quick solution, and it's even easier to end up with loads of technical debt from kludges that were never meant to stick around.</p>
            
            <p>As a responsible ML engineer and software developer, I always take the extra minute to consider not just the result we want <em>now</em>, but what we might want to have it do later on, and how easy the code is to understand and modify.</p>
            <p>In other words, I prefer to design software systems with a holistic approach, paying mind to the scalability, realiability, security, maintainability, testability, and so on. This doesn't take a lot of extra time to do either — just some experience and the right attitude.</p>

            <hr class="star">

            <p>That being said, I know you wanted a sample of code that I've actually written myself. Although I don't have permission to upload code for most ML projects I've worked on recently, I can share a few files from my Capstone design project here:</p>
            <p>(For more information about this project of mine, check it out at the top of <a href="./index.html">my website's homepage</a>)</p>


            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/main.py" target="_blank">main.py</a></strong> - The entry point for this program, which isn't very interesting. It mainly handles interpreting command-line arguments and opening SSH tunnels.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/engine/server.py" target="_blank">server.py</a></strong> - The primary load-balancing server that handles incoming user requests, dispatches them to the best available ML server, and synchronizes the databases.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/engine/predictor.py" target="_blank">predictor.py</a></strong> - The prediction engine used by each backend ML server, which trains an assortment of models on new data as it comes in (on-line learning) and makes suggestions for users when requested by the primary server.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/engine/selector.py" target="_blank">selector.py</a></strong> - The model selector for the backend ML servers; this evaluates each model against the different types of learning tasks, and determines which model performs best (according to a given metric, e.g. accuracy) for said task.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/engine/models.py" target="_blank">models.py</a></strong> - A collection of a couple of simple neural networks (mostly MLPs) that are used as the default models for the backend ML servers, but these can be overridden on a per-server basis.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/shared/types.py" target="_blank">types.py</a></strong> - Mostly a collection of enums and dataclasses that are used throughout the codebase.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="./files/pathways_predictions/shared/serial.py" target="_blank">serial.py</a></strong> - Custom serialization logic for communication between the primary and backend servers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I can't really say that I'm the <em>proudest</em> of this code, but I don't have too many other examples that I can freely share either. But there is also this project I worked on during my first ever machine learning job: <a href="https://github.com/BenChapmanKish/UG-MLRG-Project">github.com/BenChapmanKish/UG-MLRG-Project</a>.</p>
            <p>In addition to that, there are also several other projects of mine linked to on <a href="./index.html">my website's homepage</a>, so feel free to browse through there as well. Otherwise, I'm happy to demonstrate my coding skills or thought process to you during an interview.</p>

            <p><em>That's all I've got for you here, thanks for checking me out!</em></p>
